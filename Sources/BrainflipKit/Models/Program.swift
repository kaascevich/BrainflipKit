   /// ## Optimization
   ///
   /// Some constructs can be simplified to speed up program
   /// execution. The tricks currently used to optimize programs
   /// are:
   ///
   /// - Repeated occurrences of `+`, `-`, `>`, or `<` are
   ///   condensed into a single instruction.
   /// - The `[-]++`...`++` construct is replaced with a `setTo(n)`
   ///   instruction, where *n* is the number of `+` instructions
   ///   that follow `[-]`.
   ///
   /// - Parameter string: A string to parse into a `Program`.
   ///
   /// - Throws: An `Error` if `string` is not a valid program
   ///   (that is, if it contains unmatched brackets).
