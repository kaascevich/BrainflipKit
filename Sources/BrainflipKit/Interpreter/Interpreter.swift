/// Interprets and executes a Brainflip program.
///
/// # How Brainflip Works
///
/// Brainflip is a very simple programming language, only consisting of
/// eight instructions. However, creating programs in Brainflip can be a
/// challenge like no other due to this reduced instruction set.
///
/// All Brainflip programs mutate an array of *cells*, which are 8 bits
/// long by default. This array is referred to as the *tape*. A pointer
/// (not an actual `UnsafePointer`, just a `[CellValue].Index`) is used
/// to keep track of the cell that is currently being mutated.
///
/// Brainflip's instructions are as follows:
///
/// - term ``Instruction/increment``:
///     Increments current cell by 1, wrapping
///     back to 0 if necessary.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/decrement``:
///     Decrements the current cell by 1, wrapping back to ``Options/cellMax``
///     if necessary.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/nextCell``:
///     Moves the cell pointer forward 1 cell.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/prevCell``:
///     Moves the cell pointer back 1 cell.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/loop(_:)``:
///     If the current cell is 0, skips the contained instructions.
///     Otherwise, executes the instructions before repeating the
///     process.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/output``:
///     Appends the character whose Unicode value is the current
///     cell's value to the output buffer. If the current cell's
///     value does not correspond to a valid Unicode code point,
///     this instruction does nothing.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/input``:
///     Takes the next character of the input and stores its Unicode
///     value into the current cell.
///
///     When the `Interpreter` is created, characters whose values
///     are too big to fit in the cell will be removed from the
///     input string.
///
///     If there are no characters remaining in the input, this will
///     do nothing by default (this behavior is configurable).
///
/// All characters other than the ones listed above are treated as
/// comments and ignored.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// // https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/163590/59487
/// let program = ">>>>>+[-->-[>>+>-----<<]<--<---]>-.>>>+.>>..+++[.>]<<<<.+++.------.<<-.>>>>+."
/// let interpreter = try Interpreter(program)
/// let output = try interpreter.run()
/// print(output) // Hello, World!
/// ```
