/// Interprets and executes a Brainflip program.
///
/// # How Brainflip Works
///
/// Brainflip is a very simple programming language, only consisting of
/// eight instructions. However, creating programs in Brainflip can be a
/// challenge like no other due to this reduced instruction set.
///
/// All Brainflip programs mutate an array of _cells_, which are 8 bits
/// long by default. This array is referred to as the _tape_. The tape
/// is infinite in both directions. A _pointer_ is used to keep track of
/// the cell that is currently being mutated.
///
/// ## Instruction Set
///
/// ### Core Instructions
///
/// - term ``Instruction/add(_:)``:
///     Increments (or decrements) the current cell by the specified
///     amount, wrapping around if necessary.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/move(_:)``:
///     Moves the cell pointer by the specified amount. If the amount
///     is negative, move the pointer backward.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/loop(_:)``:
///     If the current cell is 0, skips the contained instructions.
///     Otherwise, executes the instructions before repeating the
///     process.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/output``:
///     Writes the character whose Unicode value is the current
///     cell's value to the output stream. If the current cell's
///     value does not correspond to a valid Unicode code point,
///    this instruction does nothing.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/input``:
///     Takes the next character of the input and stores its Unicode
///     value into the current cell.
///
///     If there are no characters remaining in the input, this
///     instruction will do nothing by default (this behavior is
///     configurable).
///
/// ### Optimization Instructions
///
/// These instructions are used internally to optimize programs.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/setTo(_:)``:
///     Sets the current cell to a specific value.
/// - term ``Instruction/scan(_:)``:
///     Moves the pointer to the next (or previous) zero
///     cell.
///
/// ### Extra Instructions
///
/// These instructions are disabled by default. They can be enabled
/// via the `options` parameter to an initializer.
///
/// - term ``ExtraInstruction/stop``:
///     Immediately ends the program by throwing a
///     ``Interpreter/Error/stopInstruction`` error.
/// - term ``ExtraInstruction/bitwiseNot``:
///     Performs a bitwise NOT on the current cell.
/// - term ``ExtraInstruction/leftShift``:
///     Performs a lossy left bit-shift on the current cell.
/// - term ``ExtraInstruction/rightShift``:
///     Performs a lossy right bit-shift on the current cell.
/// - term ``ExtraInstruction/random``:
///     Sets the current cell to a random value.
///
/// All characters other than the ones listed above are treated as
/// comments and ignored.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// let program = """
/// ++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>
/// .>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.
/// """
/// let interpreter = try await Interpreter(program)
/// let output = try await interpreter.run()
/// print(output) // Hello World!
/// ```
