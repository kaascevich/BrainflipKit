/// Interprets and executes a Brainflip program.
///
/// # How Brainflip Works
///
/// Brainflip is a very simple programming language, only consisting of
/// eight instructions. However, creating programs in Brainflip can be a
/// challenge like no other due to this reduced instruction set.
///
/// All Brainflip programs mutate an array of *cells*, which are 8 bits
/// long by default. A pointer (not an actual `UnsafePointer`, just a
/// `CellArray.Index`) is used to keep track of the cell that is currently
/// being mutated.
///
/// Brainflip's instructions are as follows:
///
/// - term ``Instruction/increment``:
///     Increments ``Interpreter/State/currentCellValue`` by 1, wrapping
///     back to 0 if necessary.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/decrement``:
///     Decrements `currentCellValue` by 1, wrapping back to ``Options/cellMax``
///     if necessary.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/nextCell``:
///     Moves ``Interpreter/State/cellPointer`` forward 1 cell.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/prevCell``:
///     Moves `cellPointer` back 1 cell.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/loop(_:)``:
///     If `currentCellValue` is 0, skips the contained instructions.
///     Otherwise, executes the instructions before repeating the
///     process.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/output``:
///     Appends the character whose Unicode value is `currentCellValue`
///     to the ``Interpreter/State/output`` buffer.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/input``:
///     Takes the next character out of the ``Interpreter/State/input``
///     buffer and stores its Unicode value into  `currentCellValue`.
///     
///     When the `Interpreter` is created, characters whose values are
///     too big to fit in the cell will be removed from the input string.
///
/// All characters other than the ones listed above are treated as
/// comments and ignored.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// // https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/163590/59487
/// let program = ">>>>>+[-->-[>>+>-----<<]<--<---]>-.>>>+.>>..+++[.>]<<<<.+++.------.<<-.>>>>+."
/// let interpreter = try Interpreter(program)
/// let output = try interpreter.run()
/// print(output) // Hello, World!
/// ```
