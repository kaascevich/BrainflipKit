/// Interprets and executes a Brainflip program.
///
/// # How Brainflip Works
///
/// Brainflip is a very simple programming language, only consisting of eight
/// instructions. However, creating programs in Brainflip can be a challenge
/// like no other due to this reduced instruction set.
///
/// All Brainflip programs mutate an array of _cells_, which are 8 bits long by
/// default. This array is referred to as the _tape_. The tape is infinite in
/// both directions. A _pointer_ is used to keep track of the cell that is
/// currently being mutated.
///
/// ## Instruction Set
///
/// ### Core Instructions
///
/// - term ``Instruction/add(_:)``:
///     Increments (or decrements) the current cell by the specified amount,
///     wrapping around if necessary.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/move(_:)``:
///     Moves the cell pointer by the specified amount. If the amount is
///     negative, move the pointer backward.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/loop(_:)``:
///     If the current cell is 0, skips the contained instructions. Otherwise,
///     executes the instructions before repeating the process.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/output``:
///     Writes the character whose Unicode value is the current cell's value to
///     the output stream. If the current cell's value does not correspond to a
///     valid Unicode code point, this instruction does nothing.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/input``:
///     Takes the next character of the input and stores its Unicode value into
///     the current cell.
///
///     If there are no characters remaining in the input, this instruction will
///     do nothing by default (this behavior is configurable).
///
/// ### Optimization Instructions
///
/// These instructions are used internally to optimize programs.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/setTo(_:)``:
///     Sets the current cell to a specific value.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/scan(_:)``:
///     Moves the pointer to the next (or previous) zero cell.
///
/// ### Extra Instructions
///
/// These instructions are disabled by default. They can be enabled via the
/// `options` parameter to an initializer.
///
/// - term ``ExtraInstruction/stop``:
///     Immediately ends the program by throwing a
///     ``Interpreter/Error/stopInstruction`` error.
///
/// - term ``ExtraInstruction/bitwiseNot``:
///     Performs a bitwise NOT on the current cell.
///
/// - term ``ExtraInstruction/leftShift``:
///     Performs a lossy left bit-shift on the current cell.
///
/// - term ``ExtraInstruction/rightShift``:
///     Performs a lossy right bit-shift on the current cell.
///
/// - term ``ExtraInstruction/random``:
///     Sets the current cell to a random value.
///
/// All characters other than the ones listed above are treated as comments and
/// ignored.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// let program = """
/// ++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>
/// .>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.
/// """
/// let interpreter = try Interpreter(program)
/// let output = try await interpreter.run()
/// print(output) // Hello World!
/// ```
