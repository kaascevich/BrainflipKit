/// Interprets and executes a Brainflip program.
///
/// # How Brainflip Works
///
/// Brainflip is a very simple programming language, only consisting of
/// eight instructions. However, creating programs in Brainflip can be a
/// challenge like no other due to this reduced instruction set.
///
/// All Brainflip programs mutate an array of *cells*. By default, the
/// array is 30,000 cells long. A pointer (not an actual `UnsafePointer`,
/// just a `CellArray.Index`) is used to keep track of the cell that is
/// currently being mutated.
///
/// Brainflip's instructions are as follows:
///
/// - term ``Instruction/increment``:
///     Increments ``Interpreter/State/currentCellValue`` by 1, wrapping
///     back to 0 if necessary.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/decrement``:
///     Decrements `currentCellValue` by 1, wrapping back to `CellValue.max`
///     if necessary.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/nextCell``:
///     Moves ``Interpreter/State/cellPointer`` forward 1 cell.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/prevCell``:
///     Moves `cellPointer` back 1 cell.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/loop(_:)``:
///     If `currentCellValue` is 0, skips the contained instructions.
///     Otherwise, executes the instructions before repeating the
///     process.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/output``:
///     Appends `currentCellValue` to the ``Interpreter/State/output``
///     buffer.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/input``:
///     Takes the next UTF-8 code onit out of the
///     ``Interpreter/State/input`` buffer and stores it into
///     `currentCellValue`.
///
/// All characters other than the ones listed above are treated as
/// comments and ignored.
///
