/// Interprets and executed a Brainflip program.
///
/// # How Brainflip Works
///
/// Brainflip is a very simple programming language, only consisting of
/// eight instructions. However, creating programs in Brainflip can be a
/// challenge like no other due to this reduced instruction set.
///
/// All Brainflip programs mutate an array of *cells* (`UInt8` instances).
/// The array is 30,000 cells long. A pointer (not an actual `UnsafePointer`,
/// just a `CellArray.Index`) is used to keep track of the cell that is
/// currently being mutated.
///
/// Brainflip's instructions are as follows:
///
/// - term ``Instruction/increment``:
///     Increments ``Interpreter/State/currentCellValue`` by 1, wrapping
///     back to 0 if necessary.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/decrement``:
///     Decrements `currentCellValue` by 1, wrapping back to `Cell.max`
///     if necessary.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/nextCell``:
///     Moves ``Interpreter/State/cellPointer`` forward 1 cell.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/prevCell``:
///     Moves `cellPointer` back 1 cell.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/loop(_:)``, with ``Instruction/LoopBound/begin``
///   as the associated value:
///     Starts a loop.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/loop(_:)``, with ``Instruction/LoopBound/end``
///   as the associated value:
///     If `currentCellValue` is 0, does nothing. Otherwise, moves
///     ``Interpreter/State/instructionPointer`` back to the matching
///     `loop(.begin)` instruction.
///
/// - term ``Instruction/output``:
///     Appends the ASCII equivalent of `currentCellValue` to the
///     ``Interpreter/State/output`` buffer.
///     
/// - term ``Instruction/input``:
///     Takes the next character out of the ``Interpreter/State/input``
///     buffer and stores its ASCII value into `currentCellValue`.
///     > Precondition: The next character of input is an ASCII
///     > character.
///
/// All characters other than the ones listed above are treated as
/// comments and ignored.
///

/// - ``Instruction``
/// - ``run(input:)``
