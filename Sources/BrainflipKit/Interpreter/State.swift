    /// Most brainf\*\*k interpreters have a fixed-size tape, but Brainflip's
    /// tape is dynamically sized (i.e. infinite). While it _would_ be possible
    /// to implement this using a standard Swift `Array`, it's not very
    /// ergonomic, requiring a whole lot of computed property shenanigans to
    /// abstract away the rather `fatalError`-y subscript.
    ///
    /// It's a lot easier to use a `Dictionary` instead, with the key
    /// representing the cell's index (and the value, of course, representing
    /// the value). This also provides the benefits of being able to use
    /// negative indices -- allowing for an infinite tape in _both_ directions,
    /// which _also_ eliminates the need to handle out-of-bounds errors -- and
    /// of using a whole lot less memory than a standard 30,000-cell `Array` in
    /// the vast majority of use cases.
    ///
    /// More details on how this works can be found in the documentation for
    /// ``currentCellValue``.

    /// index is out of bounds. In addition, assigning to a nonexistent key will
