      Brainflip is an optimizing Swift interpreter for the brainfuck \
      programming language -- an incredibly simple language that only has 8 \
      instructions. This interpreter features full Unicode support.

      Here's a list of all the differences between Brainflip and a standard, \
      run-of-the-mill brainf**k interpreter:
      - Full Unicode support
      - 32-bit cells instead of 8-bit cells ('cuz Unicode)
      - Infinite tape in both directions
      - Customizable end-of-input behavior
      - Cell wrapping can be disabled
      - Relatively basic optimizations, including:
        - Condensing repeated instructions
        - Merging `+`/`-` and `<`/`>` instructions
        - Removing instructions that cancel each other out
        - Replacing `[-]` with a dedicated instruction
        - Replacing copy/multiplication loops with a dedicated instruction
        - Replacing scan loops (such as `[>>]`) with a dedicated instruction
