      Brainflip is an optimizing Swift interpreter for the brainf**k \
      programming language -- an incredibly simple language that only has 8 \
      instructions. This interpreter features full Unicode support, as well as \
      languange extensions in the form of extra instructions (which can be \
      enabled or disabled at will).
      
      Here's a list of all the differences between Brainflip and a standard, \
      run-of-the-mill brainf**k interpreter:
       - Full Unicode support
       - 32-bit cells instead of 8-bit cells ('cuz Unicode)
       - Infinite tape in both directions
       - Customizable end-of-input behavior
       - Cell wrapping can be disabled
       - Optional extra instructions
       - Relatively basic optimizations, including:
         - Condensing repeated instructions
         - Merging `+`/`-` and `<`/`>` instructions
         - Removing instructions that cancel each other out
         - Replacing `[-]` with a dedicated instruction
         - Replacing copy/multiplication loops with a dedicated instruction
         - Replacing scan loops (such as `[>>]`) with a dedicated instruction
